<h1 style="color:green;"> 1. Introduce</h1>

Even though I've not had experience having a job as a programmer, I want to be a good programmer dealing with data in Database.

In my opinion, Programming is a part of developing electronic and electrical machine. So, I've concerned understanding this process will help me being a developmer knowing how to impove the machine.

For this goal, I am trying to understand basic for code such as assign memoery, processing from hight level language to low level language.
